# songbook

A collection of song lyrics with accompanying guitar chords in a
printer-friendly format. I keep them here for my own convenience, but feel free
to use them as you like. Keep in mind, however:

The chords presented here are based on what I hear, limited to what I can play,
and sometimes adapted to suit my vocal range. I have no formal musical
education; I'm a self-taught amateur guitar player and an average singer. As a
result, the chords may (and often do) differ slightly from those you might find
elsewhere on the internet. You have been warned!
