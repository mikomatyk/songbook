# Songbook

A collection of song lyrics with accompanying guitar chords in a
printer-friendly format. I keep them here for my own convenience, but feel free
to use them as you like. Keep in mind, however:

The guitar chords presented here are based on what I hear, limited to what I can
play, and sometimes adapted to suit my vocal range. I have no formal musical
education; I'm a self-taught amateur guitar player and an average singer. As a
result, the chords may (and often do) differ slightly from those you might find
elsewhere on the internet. You have been warned!

## Key notation

I use the Polish key notation, where the note B is denoted as H, and B is used
to represent A# (or Bb). See the following:

    English
    C  C#  D  D#  E  F  F#  G  G#  A  A#  B  C
       Db     Eb        Gb     Ab     Bb
    Polish
    C  C#  D  D#  E  F  F#  G  G#  A  A#  H  C
       Db     Eb        Gb     Ab     B

In song lyrics side notes, major chords are written in uppercase letters, and
minor chords in lowercase letters. Semitones are always in sharp notation, never
flat (i.e. F#, not Gb).
